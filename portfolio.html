            <p>As a former youth leader, it is really my passion to serve people. With that experienced, I’ve learn how to manage people in listening to them and providing their needs. I also have the fund given by the government to raise awareness and projects to support them. I am a hardworking person and I hate being late because time is really important for everyone. Commitment to a job is a serious matter and I love giving my best to provide good service for other people.</p>
